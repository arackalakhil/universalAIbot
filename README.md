    <h1>AI Chat Bot README</h1>
    <p>This README file provides an overview of the AI Chat Bot code and how it works. The code is implemented in Python and uses PyTorch, nltk (Natural Language Toolkit), and json libraries. The AI Chat Bot is trained using a dataset in JSON format containing intents and responses.</p>
  <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python 3.x</li>
        <li>PyTorch</li>
        <li>nltk</li>
        <li>json</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Files:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>main.py</strong>: This file contains the main script for the AI Chat Bot. It loads the pre-trained model, interacts with the user, tokenizes user input, and generates responses based on the trained model.</li>
        <li><strong>model.py</strong>: This file contains the implementation of the neural network model for the Chat Bot. The model is a simple feedforward neural network with three linear layers and ReLU activation.</li>
        <li><strong>nltk_utils.py</strong>: This file contains utility functions for tokenization and bag-of-words representation of sentences using nltk.</li>
    </ol>

   <h2>Training the Model:</h2>
    <p>Before running the main script, you need to train the model on a labeled dataset. The training data should be in JSON format, where each intent has a tag, patterns (user inputs), and responses. Below is an example of the training data format:</p>
    <pre>
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": [
                "Hi",
                "How are you",
                "Is anyone there?",
                "Hello",
                "Good day",
                "Greetings",
                "Namaste",
                "Om",
                "Shri Krishna"
            ],
            "responses": [
                "Hello, thanks for visiting",
                "Good to see you again",
                "Hi there, how can I help?",
                "Greetings! How may I be of service?",
                "Om Shanti",
                "Shri Krishna is always with you",
                "I am here to help you on your journey",
                "What can I do for you today?"
            ],
            "context_set": ""
        },
        // Add more intents here as needed
    ]
}
    </pre>

   <h2>Running the AI Chat Bot:</h2>
    <p>To interact with the AI Chat Bot, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that you have the "data.pth" file generated during training in the same directory as "main.py".</li>
        <li>Run the "main.py" script. The AI Chat Bot will greet you and wait for your input.</li>
        <li>Type your questions or messages, and the AI Chat Bot will respond based on the trained model's predictions.</li>
    </ol>

   <h2>Note:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The code assumes that the training data is in the "train.json" file. Make sure to replace this file with your custom dataset if needed.</li>
        <li>The AI Chat Bot's responses depend on the trained model's accuracy, which may vary depending on the size and quality of the training dataset. You can experiment with the training parameters to improve the model's performance.</li>
    </ul>

   <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The AI Chat Bot in this code is a basic implementation for educational purposes. For production-grade AI chatbots, you may need to use more advanced models and fine-tune them on a larger and more diverse dataset. Additionally, always handle user data responsibly and securely to protect users' privacy and information.</p>
